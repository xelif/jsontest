to reviews, gaming content, and daily vlogs by popular influencers.\n\nYouTube also
offers an app for iOS which provides a more smooth and enjoyable experience watching
videos on your iPhone. Unfortunately, the app lacks a lot of essential

with other devices via AirDrop\nâ€¢ Background playback for streamed and downloaded
